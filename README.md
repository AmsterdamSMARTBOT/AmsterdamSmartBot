# Smart BOT

This chatbot has been developed to be used in Amsterdam smart city environment.
It is based on an interactive conversation with the user.
The specialization is for searching parking and electric charge points in AMSTERDAM.


An example of typical input would be something like this:

> **user:** Good morning! How are you doing?  

> **smartBOT:**  Hello and how are you this morning? I'm doing great, how about you?  

> **user:** I'm fine aswell

> **smartBOT:** Glad to hear it 

> **user:** Can you find me the closest parking in Amsterdam?

> **smartBOT:** Yes, I was created to search parkings in Amsterdam

> **smartBOT:** Would you mind shering your location to search the closest parking? ...  

## How it works

The iteration with the chatbot is possible thanks to AIML, Artificial Inteligence Markup Language, an XML dialect for creating natural language.
Through different keywords the service is able to understand and recommend the parking locations asked from the user.
